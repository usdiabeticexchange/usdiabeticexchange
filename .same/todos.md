### Google Sheets Integration Features:

### Your Google Sheets CSV URL:
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQKyuGyVeB6_EMydb8kxP0wiZXyxVFsaaNiM0w6yMj5w4tGomMNWn6glhqlfDJd1laA583L1EL91ZA3/pub?output=csv`

## Next Steps:
1. **Test Live Site** - Visit https://usdiabeticexchange.com to see the optimized integration
2. **Check Console** - Open browser DevTools to see `[PriceSync]` logs
3. **Manual Sync** - Run `window.PRICE_SYNC_MANUAL()` in console if needed
4. **Update Prices** - Edit your Google Sheets and prices will sync within 5 minutes

## Expected Spreadsheet Format:
Your CSV should have columns like:
- `Product_Name` (or `product_name`, `name`, `Product`)
- `6 months until expiration` (or `6`, `6_months`)
- `7-8 months until expiration` (or `7-8`, `7_to_8`)
- `9+ months until expiration` (or `9+`, `9_plus`)

The system is now much more reliable and easier to debug!
